# Mental Health in Tech Industry 2019 

DEFINE A GOAL

The point of this Power BI report is to visualize the mental health in tech industry in 2019.

SEARCH & DOWNLOAD DATA

For the row dataset was retrieved from Kaggle and downloaded into a csv format.

DATA LOADING & EXPLORING

Loading the row dataset into Power Query and start exploring the dataset to define how to use, clean and transform this dataset to meet the project goal.

DATA CLEANSING & TRANSFORMATION

After exploring the dataset, I already had an idea about the data quality and how the dataset needs to be cleaned, which columns and rows to remove, which to reformat, which to rename and reorderâ€¦.etc.

Removing unnecessary columns
Remove empty, error/unrelated, unnecessary rows
Re-write values
Reformat/ recreate columns
Below you can find data cleansing steps in M Language

```

 After finishing cleaning, the data, it was loaded to Power Desktop to start creating the report.

REPORT DESIGNING

After being the data ready to visualize and before start creating the report, first I plan on how to design the report since it is multi-page and includes a lot of information to visualize. I start answering:

- How to present the data? 
- How many pages?
- What dose each page present/ what is each page goal?
- How each page will achieve its goal?


REPORT CREATING

After deciding how to visualize the data, I started creating the repot. First, I set up the background layout page (color, title, font.etc) then I started creating the dashboard.

Below you will find the final report.
